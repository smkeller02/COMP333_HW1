    <h2>What is the difference between Public and Private Accounts?</h2>
    <h3 class="faq_answer">
        On MusicUnited, you have the option to set your account as either Private or Public.
        <br>
        When you set your account to Private, your music ratings and Music Personality are only visible to you and your friends. 
        <br>
        If you choose to make your account Public, your music ratings and preferences are shared with any MusicUnited users.
